# Notes App Back-End

Notes App Back-End is a practice project built with Node.js and the Hapi.js framework. It serves as a backend for managing notes, providing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations following RESTful API standards.

## Features

- **Create Note**: Add a new note with a title and content.
- **Get All Notes**: Retrieve a list of all notes.
- **Get Note by ID**: Retrieve a specific note by its ID.
- **Update Note**: Modify an existing note by its ID.
- **Delete Note**: Remove a note by its ID.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for server-side applications.
- **Hapi.js** - Web framework for building robust APIs.
- **Nodemon** - Enables automatic server restarts during development.

## Installation & Running the Application

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have installed:

- **Node.js** (Latest LTS version recommended)
- **npm** (Comes with Node.js)
